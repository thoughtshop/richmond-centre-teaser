SHAPE is dedicated to treating your Personal Information with care and&nbsp;respect.</p>
        <p>SHAPE is subject to British Columbia’s Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA”) and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) where Personal Information crosses provincial boundaries and international borders. SHAPE is subject to other laws besides privacy laws and is obligated to protect your financial information as&nbsp;well.</p>
        <p>When you use our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of our Privacy Notice. If you do not want SHAPE to use or disclose your Personal Information in the ways identified in our Privacy Notice, please do not use our&nbsp;Services.</p>

        <h2 class="divider-after">Simplifed Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Personal&nbsp;Information.</h3>
        <p>Personal Information is information that can be used to identify an individual. Personal Information does not include business Contact&nbsp;Information.</p>
        
        <h3>Collecting personal information and&nbsp;purposes.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE will collect different Personal Information from you depending on the Services you are using. The information we collect will be necessary and reasonable for the purpose, which may be:</p>

          <li>to respond to your request;
          <li>to identify you and contact you about SHAPE projects;</li>
          <li>to complete your purchase transaction;</li>
          <li>to comply with our regulatory requirements;</li>
          <li>to complete a background or credit check;</li>
          <li>to assess your creditworthiness;</li>
          <li>to assess your suitability as a tenant; or</li>
          <li>to complete your rental&nbsp;transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consent</h3>

        <h3>Keeping personal&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE will keep your Personal Information for at least one year if we use it to make a decision about you. Other than that, we keep it only for as long as necessary to fulfill the identified or related&nbsp;purpose.</p>

        <h3>Ensuring&nbsp;accuracy.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE relies on you to provide accurate Personal Information, but if we need to use it to make a decision about you or have to disclose it in order to deliver our Services, we will do our best to make sure it is accurate and&nbsp;complete.</p>

        <h3>Securing personal&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE protects your Personal Information using standard and reasonable security&nbsp;practices.</p>
        <p>SHAPE makes sure that the organizations that help us deliver our Services protect your Personal Information&nbsp;too.</p>
        <p>We do our best to protect your Personal Information but we cannot guarantee its&nbsp;security.</p>

        <h3>Location of&nbsp;services.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE is located in Canada but the organizations that help us deliver our Services may be in other countries. Laws in these other countries may not protect your Personal Information the same way our Canadian laws&nbsp;do.</p>
        
        <h3>Individual&nbsp;access.</h3>
        <p>You can contact us in writing to request access to the Personal Information about you that SHAPE holds or ask with whom we have shared&nbsp;it.</p>

        <h3>Cookies and other tracking&nbsp;technologies.</h3>

        <h3>Additional features and&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>It is best not to send any sensitive Personal Information by email, as emailing is not secure way to&nbsp;communicate.</p>

        <h3>Employee&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE protects the Personal Information of job applicants and employees&nbsp;too.</p>

        <h3>Changing this privacy&nbsp;notice.</h3>
        <p>If SHAPE updates this Privacy Notice, we will let you&nbsp;know.</p>
        <p>You should review our Privacy Notice periodically and contact us if you have any&nbsp;questions.</p>

        <h3>Questions and&nbsp;complaints.</h3>
        <p>Our Privacy Officer makes sure we comply with privacy laws and will respond to any of your questions, concerns or&nbsp;complaints.</p>
        <p>If our Privacy Officer cannot resolve an issue, you can contact the Privacy&nbsp;Commissioner.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 class="divider-after">Detailed Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Personal&nbsp;Information.</h3>
        <p>Personal Information is any information that can be used to uniquely identify a specific&nbsp;individual.</p>
        <p>We will inform you of why and how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information, obtain consent where required and only handle Personal Information in a manner that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
        <p>Personal Information does not include Contact Information, which is information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business and includes name, position or title, business telephone number, business address, business email or business fax number. PIPA and PIPEDA do not cover Contact Information. This Privacy Notice does not cover Contact&nbsp;Information.</p>

        <h3>Collecting personal information and&nbsp;purposes.</h3>
        <p>The Personal Information that SHAPE collects will be different depending on the Services being provided. We will only collect Personal Information that is necessary for the purpose of providing a particular Service, with your consent where&nbsp;required.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of specific purposes:</p>
        <ul class="columns">
          <li>To complete a purchase transaction, we will collect your full name, address, phone number, email address, SIN and a copy of your government-issued identification confirming your residency&nbsp;status.</li>
          <li>To comply with regulatory requirements, for example to verify personal identification according to regulatory requirements (FINTRAC) or to register property sale assignments with the Land Title and Survey Authority of British Columbia, we will collect your name, home address, date of birth, employment information, residency information and photo&nbsp;ID.</li>
          <li>To complete background and credit checks, we will collect your employment information, lease/rental history, educational background and other financial and legal&nbsp;information.</li>
          <li>To assess creditworthiness as a commercial tenant or guarantor of a commercial lease, we will collect your full name, name of spouse, residential address, home ownership information, date of birth, phone number and financial&nbsp;information.</li>
          <li>To assess suitability as a prospective residential tenant, we will collect your full name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, SIN, citizenship information, rental history, employment information, photo ID, emergency contact information and financial&nbsp;information.</li>
          <li>To complete a residential rental transaction, we will collect your full name, address, phone number and email&nbsp;address.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SHAPE does not knowingly or intentionally collect Personal Information from&nbsp;minors.</p>

        <h3>Consent</h3>
        <p>We will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose Personal Information except where, as noted below, we are authorized to do so without&nbsp;consent.</p>
        <p>In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, legal, medical or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. Seeking consent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. In addition, organizations that do not have a direct relationship with an individual may not always be able to seek consent from that&nbsp;individual.</p>
        <p>We may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent:</p>
        <ul class="columns">
          <li>when the Personal Information is available from a public source;</li>
          <li>when we require advice from a lawyer;</li>
          <li>for the purposes of collecting a debt; and</li>
          <li>to protect ourselves from&nbsp;fraud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using and sharing personal&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>SHAPE will only use or share Personal Information where necessary to fulfill the purposes identified at the time of collection or for a purpose reasonably related to those initially identified purposes. We will also use Personal Information to:</p>
        <p>Where your Personal Information may be disclosed to SHAPE partners and co-owners in the course of a lease or purchase transaction, you will be informed of the possibility at the time the information is&nbsp;collected.</p>
        <p>We will not use or disclose Personal Information for any additional purpose unless we obtain consent to do so. We will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties unless we have your consent to do&nbsp;so.</p>
        <p>Privacy law does not cover information that does not uniquely identify an individual. SHAPE may generate and use anonymous information, data that does not identify a specific individual, for our own business&nbsp;purposes.</p>

        <h3>Keeping personal&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>If we use Personal Information to make a decision that directly affects you, we will keep that Personal Information for at least one year so that you have a reasonable opportunity to request access to&nbsp;it.</p>
        <p>Subject to the above, we will keep your Personal Information only as long as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or a related business or legal&nbsp;purpose.</p>
        <p>You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the&nbsp;message.</p>

        <h3>Securing personal&nbsp;information.</h3>
        <p>We use industry standard security practices and take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. We train our teams to follow our privacy and security practices, including the principles of privacy by&nbsp;design.</p>
        <p>Using contracts, we ensure that any third party acting on our behalf in respect of receiving, handling or storing your Personal Information maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards. Third parties acting on our behalf are not permitted to use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the&nbsp;Services.</p>
        <p>We will use appropriate security measures when destroying Personal Information such as deleting electronically stored&nbsp;information.</p>
        <p>We will continually review and update our security policies and controls as technology changes to ensure ongoing Personal Information security. However, please bear in mind that no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free and no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any information that you share with&nbsp;us.</p>

        <h3>Location of&nbsp;services.</h3>
        <p>While SHAPE is located in Canada, we may transfer Personal Information to other countries for processing, including using third party service providers located in countries other than Canada. You understand that your Personal Information may be transferred to a country that may have different privacy protections than Canada.

        <p>It is important to guard your privacy when you are online. If our websites or other electronic communications contain links to other websites, this Privacy Notice does not govern those websites. Regardless of the source of those links, you should read the associated privacy notices and make an informed decision about whether you want to use those websites or the services advertised on the&nbsp;websites.</p>
