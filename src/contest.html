          <p>2. HOW TO ENTER: </p>
          <p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY.</p>
          <p>Completing and Submitting Your Entry</p>
          <p>To enter, go to http://liveatcfrc.com/ (the “Website”). Fully complete the “Registration Form” (the “Entry Form”) with all required information, which requires you to: (i) enter a valid email address, your first and last name, your full birthdate, postal code and a valid telephone number; (ii) signify your agreement that you have read and agree to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these official rules and regulations (the “Rules”); and (iii) indicate that you would like to receive additional information regarding upcoming events or promotions from the Contest Organizers. Once you have fully completed the Entry Form with all required information, click the “Register” button to submit your completed Contest entry (the “Entry”). To be eligible, your Entry must be submitted and received within the Contest Period. All eligible Entries submitted and received during the Contest Period will be entered into the random prize draw. </p>
          
          <p>Entry Limitations and Restrictions</p>
          <p>There is a limit of one (1) Entry per person and per email address permitted during the Contest Period. The sole determinant of time for the purposes of a valid Entry during the Contest Period will be the Contest’s server machine(s). </p>
          
          <p>Entry Verification and Entry Rejection</p>
          <p>All Entries are subject to verification at any time and for any reason. The Contest Organizers reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to require proof of identity of entrant and/or eligibility of its Entry (in a form acceptable to the Contest Organizers – including, without limitation, government issued photo identification) for the purposes of administering this Contest in accordance with these Rules. Failure to provide such proof to the satisfaction of the Contest Organizers in a timely manner may result in disqualification in the sole and absolute discretion of the Contest Organizers. </p>
          
          <p>If it is discovered by the Contest Organizers (using any evidence or other information made available to or otherwise discovered by the Contest Organizers) that any person has attempted to: (i) obtain more than one (1) Entry during the Contest Period; (ii) use (or attempt to use) multiple names, identities, email addresses, accounts and/or any automated, macro, script, robotic or other system(s) or program(s) to enter or otherwise participate in or disrupt this Contest; (iii) not respect these Rules and/or (iv) behave in a manner that otherwise undermines the integrity, fairness or administration of the Contest, then he/she may be disqualified from the Contest in the sole and absolute discretion of the Contest Organizers. </p>
          
          <p>In the event of a dispute regarding who submitted an Entry, Entries will be deemed to have been submitted by the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of entry. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the person who is assigned an email address by an internet provider, online service provider, or other organization (e.g. business, educational institute, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.</p>
          
          <p>Your Entry may be rejected if (in the sole and absolute discretion of the Contest Organizers) your Entry is incomplete or is not submitted and received during the Contest Period or is otherwise in breach with the terms and conditions set out in these Rules. The Released Parties (defined below) are not responsible for late, lost, misdirected, delayed, incomplete or incompatible Entries, all of which will be void and rejected. The Contests Parties' decision to disqualify an Entry or entrant shall be final without right of appeal.</p>
